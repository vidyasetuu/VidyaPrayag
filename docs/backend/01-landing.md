## DB tables used

| Table | Operation |
|---|---|
| `cms_landing_content` | READ (full scan, <20 rows) |

## How the data is stored

`cms_landing_content` is a small KV table (`key VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY`,
`value TEXT`). Object/array fields like `parent_info` or `list_of_offerings`
are stored as raw JSON in `value` and parsed in the route handler. This keeps
the schema simple and CMS-friendly — you can edit a single row in the DB to
push a new tagline live.

## How to edit the content

```sql
UPDATE cms_landing_content SET value = 'Education with Joy.' WHERE key = 'top_tagline';
UPDATE cms_landing_content SET value = '[{"icon_url":"…","heading":"…","description":"…","is_live":true}]' WHERE key = 'list_of_offerings';
```

To re-seed from scratch (DESTRUCTIVE):
```sql
DELETE FROM cms_landing_content;
-- restart server → Seed.populateIfEmpty() refills it
```

## cURL test

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/content/landing | jq
```
