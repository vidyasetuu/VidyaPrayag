/*
 * File: OtpDeliveryProvider.kt
 * Module: feature.auth
 *
 * THIN FACADE in front of the new multi-provider delivery layer.
 *
 *   feature.auth.OtpDeliveryProvider          ← this file (legacy entry point)
 *           │
 *           ▼  delegates to
 *   feature.auth.delivery.OtpDeliveryDispatcher
 *           │
 *           ▼  iterates
 *   ConsoleProvider / Fast2SmsProvider / Msg91Provider /
 *   TwilioProvider / WhatsAppCloudProvider / SmtpEmailProvider
 *
 * Why a facade?  The existing OtpService.kt calls
 * `OtpDeliveryProvider.deliver(...)` and expects a simple `DeliveryOutcome`
 * back. We keep that surface stable so a) nothing else has to change in
 * the auth feature and b) we can still inject test doubles by overriding
 * just this object.
 *
 * The `attempts` list on the new `DeliveryOutcome` is the full audit
 * trail that OtpService persists to `otp_delivery_attempts` for forensics.
 *
 * Configuration is fully env-driven — see .env.example for the full
 * list of provider knobs (FAST2SMS_*, MSG91_*, TWILIO_*, WHATSAPP_*,
 * SMTP_*, OTP_PROVIDER, OTP_CHANNEL_ORDER, OTP_PROVIDER_ORDER).
