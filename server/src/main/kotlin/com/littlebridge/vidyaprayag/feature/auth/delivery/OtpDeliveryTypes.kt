/*
 * File: OtpDeliveryTypes.kt
 * Module: feature.auth.delivery
 *
 * Common type definitions for the pluggable OTP-delivery layer.
 *
 *  - OtpChannel       : "sms" | "whatsapp" | "email" | "voice" | "console"
 *  - OtpDeliveryRequest : everything a provider needs to send one OTP
 *  - OtpDeliveryResult  : Sent | Skipped | Failed (with reason + provider id)
 *  - OtpProvider        : the contract every concrete provider implements
 *
 * The actual concrete providers (Fast2SMS, MSG91, Twilio, WhatsApp Cloud,
 * SMTP, Console) live in sibling files inside this package and are wired
 * up in `OtpDeliveryDispatcher`. They are completely free to come and go
 * — adding a new SMS gateway is just:
 *
 *   1) Drop in a new `SomeProvider.kt` that implements `OtpProvider`.
 *   2) Add it to `OtpDeliveryDispatcher.buildProviderChain()`.
 *   3) Document its env vars in `.env.example`.
 *
 * No other file needs to change. No interfaces are leaked outside
 * `feature.auth.delivery` so we keep the public OTP API surface tiny.

 * otherwise SMS" without caring which vendor does it.
