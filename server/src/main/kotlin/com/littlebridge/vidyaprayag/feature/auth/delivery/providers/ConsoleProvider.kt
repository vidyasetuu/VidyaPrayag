/*
 * File: ConsoleProvider.kt
 * Module: feature.auth.delivery.providers
 *
 * "Last resort" / dev provider. Prints the OTP to the server's stdout
 * and ALWAYS succeeds.
 *
 * When does it run in production?
 *   - It SHOULD NOT. It's only added to the provider chain when
 *     OTP_ENABLE_CONSOLE_FALLBACK=true (default: true in dev, MUST be
 *     false in prod).
 *
 * Why keep it at all?
 *   - Local dev with no SMS provider configured.
 *   - CI / Postman regression tests — pair with OTP_DEV_RETURN_CODE=true.
 *   - Lets the OTP service stay green during a multi-provider outage so
 *     internal staff testing can continue (gated by an env flag).
 *
 * Privacy note
 * ------------
 * The plain code is printed ONLY by this provider. Every other provider
 * (real ones) treats the code as a secret and never logs it.
