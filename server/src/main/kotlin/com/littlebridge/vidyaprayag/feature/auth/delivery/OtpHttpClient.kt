/*
 * File: OtpHttpClient.kt
 * Module: feature.auth.delivery
 *
 * Shared Ktor HTTP client used by EVERY HTTP-based OTP provider
 * (Fast2SMS, MSG91, Twilio, WhatsApp Cloud, generic webhook).
 *
 * Design notes
 * ------------
 *  - Singleton — Ktor clients are heavy (thread pools, connection cache);
 *    making one per provider would leak resources on every send.
 *  - Aggressive but bounded timeouts (5 s connect, 8 s request, 15 s socket)
 *    — an OTP that takes 30 s to deliver is useless; we want fast failover
 *    to the next provider in the chain.
 *  - Built-in retries are deliberately DISABLED. Provider retries are the
 *    dispatcher's job (so it can switch channels, not just hammer the
 *    same dead endpoint).
 *  - Logging level = NONE so we never echo the OTP code to stdout on a
 *    debug build. Provider files do their own structured logging that
 *    omits the code.
